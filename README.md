# travel-itinerary

Working on a full stack MERN application!

I like working on both the frontend and the backend so I thought I would work on a MERN application to add into my github portfolio.

This application is supposed to mock what an online travel fare aggregator would look like!

It uses technologies such as Javascript, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB (and mongoose), HTML, CSS and much much more!
